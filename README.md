# Youtube-Playlist-Length
I found myself using a tool to calculate the total length of videos in a youtube playlist quite often. I do this to check if I have enough time to complete the course. So, decided to build one myself.I have made use of official youtube API to extract each video details and sum up the overall time duration. Only HTML, Tailwind CSS and vanilla JS are the tech stacks used.
